<h2>Java Lab Cycles</h2>

<h3>Java Cycle 1</h3>

1.print “hello world”<br>
2.add two numbers<br>
3.check given no is odd or even<br>
4.check given no is prime or not<br>
5.find the sum of first “n” natural numbers<br>
6.find the factor of a given number<br>
7.print Fibonacci series<br>
8.factorial of first n numbers<br>
9.check given no is palindrome or not<br>
10.amstrong or not

<h3>Java Cycle 2</h3>

1.Write a Java class having overloaded methods to calculate area of rectangle
and circle.<br>

2.Define a class Queue for representing a queue data structure. The class must
define a default constructor, a parameterized constructor and functions for enqueue,
de-queue and display operations. Write a Java program to implement
this.<br>

3.Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating
a class named 'Triangle' without any parameter in its constructor.<br>

4.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its
length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a method named 'returnArea' which returns
the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.<br>

5.Create a class with a method that prints "This is parent class" and its subclass with another method that
prints "This is child class". Now, create an object for each of the class and call
1 - method of parent class by object of parent class
2 - method of child class by object of child class
3 - method of parent class by object of child class
